Q2. Difference between a Library and Framework
Library - collection of pre-defined helper functions, objects, classes, modules that can be used in code to boost the development. By using a library, you can control the flow of the application and call the library. Eg: React, JQuery, Lodash

Framework - Foundation upon which applications are built. In contrast, when you use a framework, the control is inverted, i.e., the framework controls the flow and calls your code. Eg: Node JS, Angular, Spring

When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed

eg- REACT(library), Vue JS(framework)

Q4. Why is React known as React?
React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The name React was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it.
